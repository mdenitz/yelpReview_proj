{"author": "Vi\u00eb D.", "content": "In the meantime there were long lines everywhere, we decided to come in Hide because there's was no line here, we waited 7 mins to get set up. The service was mehh! Cash only, as they put the sign outdoor.FOODS : I am a picky eater, so mind me if you are the same. Everything has no flavor but salt, I have never tried any miso soup this bad. The food was not super salty, but it felt like they didn't put anything else but salt in their food. Even the side dish screams salt only lol. The salmon sashimi was not good. I wished I didn't order the salmon sashimi plate on top of my salmon sashimi combo. We ordered the beef teriyaki, it seems like the beef was not marinated, all they did was cooking it and put the teriyaki sauce on top, that's it, that's why inside of the beef, it was so bland. The only thing I would give 4 stars was the geoduck & scallops & mushroom dynamite. I had tried one that was much much better, so they don't earn 5 stars from me for this. I will not come back :)", "rating": "1 star rating"},
{"author": "Rebecca C.", "content": "I've passed by Hide Sushi many times and it always seems like there's a bit of a wait (just like every other place in Sawtelle!) to get a spot, but today it seemed like the wait was shorter than usual so we decided to give it a try. While we were waiting, we noticed that there's a sign on the door that notes that it's a cash-only establishment, but they do have an ATM inside. Tthe charge was maybe $1.60 to use it; my boyfriend got cash out and noted that it was cheaper than he expected. The person who was running the wait list was really friendly and the interior is super cute. I got the dinner combination with the beef teriyaki and the salmon sashimi, both of which were decent but nothing too impressive. It came with rice and sunomono with sesame seed. I think the cabbage-looking thing is tsukemono because it's listed on the website, but the menu on the website is slightly different than the PDF/QR code menu that opens up, which doesn't list this. I'm not sure if they were supposed to include the cabbage-looking thing to be honest because they also randomly brought me a miso soup which I didn't order--it wasn't a problem because I was thinking about ordering it, and a happy surprise. They did forget my rice for the dinner combination though (which they brought after I asked), so I think the service could use some improvement. I don't have any allergies or anything like that so it's not a problem if I'm brought someone else's order/an extra dish or something, but be careful if you do. My boyfriend got the spicy tuna, shrimp, salmon/avocado, yellowtail & scallion, and the scallops special roll. The shrimp was probably the least impressive of these and I think we would skip this the next time, but the last two were great. The cut roll pieces here seem like they have a little bit more height/are a little bigger than what I'm used to from other places, so even though they have just 4 pieces I thought it was a reasonable serving size. I think the best part though was the sushi (it's in the name after all!). Next time if I were to come, I would skip the dinner combinations in favor of the rolls.", "rating": "4 star rating"}
